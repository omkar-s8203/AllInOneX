How to Implement This in React
You can structure the forms dynamically by creating a generic component that adapts to each profile type. For example:

Create Components for Each Profile Type: You can create a separate component for each profile type (e.g., AddressProfile.jsx, MedicalProfile.jsx) and render the corresponding fields conditionally.

Use Dynamic Form Fields: For each profile, create a state that holds the values of each form field and update them based on user input.

Reusable Field Components: For common fields (e.g., TextInput, Dropdown, Checkbox), create reusable components that can be imported and used across different profiles.
